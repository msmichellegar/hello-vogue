# Hello Vogue

This is a mini HTML/CSS challenge, taking you to the next level beyond a classic "Hello world!". You'll be styling a basic page that looks like this:

![hello vogue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10683087/23728644/da5e447c-0455-11e7-848f-1b037607bcbc.png)

## Where to start

Go to [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/), and start a new pen. You'll be writing your HTML and CSS in the labelled boxes at the top, and the finished product should appear down the bottom.

## The HTML

You will need the following:

* An `h1` tag with the text "Hello Vogue!"
* An `img` tag linking to [the following picture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10683087/25909908/83f1233e-35a6-11e7-9155-ecd075843774.jpg)

## The CSS

Your page needs to be styled according to the following rules:

* The entire page (known as the `body`) needs to have a background color of `#8AC73E`, and all content needs to be centered using the `text-align` property
* The "Hello Vogue!" text needs to be in Helvetica and have a font size of 60px
* The image needs to have a height of 400px, and a 3px-wide, solid black border

## Tips

Don't know how to do something? Google it! Programmers would be lost without Google. For example if you want to find out how to center all the content in the page, search for "how to center content of a page in CSS". I promise you will find the answer.

## Stretch Goals

Finish early? Here are some extra challenges:

* Link your image to [vogue.co.uk](http://vogue.co.uk), so that the website opens when you click on it
* Make the text all caps using the CSS `text-transform` property
* Put 1px of spacing in between every character of the text using the CSS `letter-spacing` property
* Change the color of the text when you hover over it
